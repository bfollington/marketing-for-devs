- try and understand your [[audience]], don’t *design* your audience, people can smell inauthenticity and dispassion a mile out
- the personal will end up being the universal, say what you find interesting, be specific, let the others find you
- who DO you attract? lean into the Venn diagram of your interests and what people respond to
- [[Tim Ferris]] writes posts and does podcasts that he believes 10% of his audience will *love*, instead of what the majority might *like*. 
	- There a lot of likeable content (too much) but there’s much, much less loveable content
	- This is important for motivation too, it's easy to do things you love

- the best way to form a genuine connection with both distant strangers and close friends is to honestly share who you are
- extrinsic rewards will come when the work resonates, the work will resonate when it is authentic
- it's okay to be neurotic in public
- the goal is for someone to say "[[Oh, I'm not alone]]"
