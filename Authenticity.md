- try and understand your [[audience]], donâ€™t *design* your audience, people can smell inauthenticity and dispassion a mile out
- the personal will end up being the universal, say what you find interesting, be specific, let the others find you
- who DO you attract? lean into the Venn diagram of your interests and what people respond to

Notes from https://tim.blog/2021/10/18/how-i-built-the-tim-ferriss-show-podcast-transcript/

- the best way to form a genuine connection with both distant strangers and close friends is to honestly share who you are
- extrinsic rewards will come when the work resonates, the work will resonate when it is authentic
- it's okay to be neurotic in public
- the goal is for someone to say "[[Oh, I'm not alone]]"
