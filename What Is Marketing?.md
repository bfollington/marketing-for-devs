> Marketing is the outer layer of this psychic playground that you've built that you’re trying to share. It has to be tempting, friendly, inviting so that people want to move further in.

> Share the benefit, not the product.
> Users don't care what you sell, they care about how they get value:
> • Start with an action verb
> • Make a bold claim
> • Talk directly to your persona
> 
> Hook the users so they NEED to read on.

> People won't do the work of finding out what you do or what you could do __for them__, you have to lay the breadcrumbs for them to follow. Marketing and onboarding funnels are no different to any other user journey, put yourself in the seat of the user and consider how you can tailor content to their current context.
