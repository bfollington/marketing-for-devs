Every project or brand exists in **dialogue** with it's audience. We don't buy into products or services, we're programmed to buy into narrative and story.

Being inside cultural dialogue and being an active participant in your audiences lives is essential. If you're outside of the conversation, you're no longer relevant. Staying in dialogue with your [[audience]] requires great [[creativity]]:

>_Creativity_ fuels relevancy. It’s an internal mantra that permeates everything a brand does. It’s the organizing principle of a company, and a North Star of teamwork, processes, communication, and problem-solving. Creativity doesn’t exist in isolation; it requires diverse information sources, a more nuanced interpretation of history, heritage, culture, and digging deeper beyond the surface trends. Creativity is key for a brand taking part in cultural dialogue, not being outside of it.
